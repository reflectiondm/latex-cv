	I have been working in the software development industry for more than 10 years and I
	am still passionate and excited about it. I believe that great software is built
	only when people work together, share their ideas and insights and push the whole
	community forward. I like coding, making ideas a reality, and I enjoy working with
	people, mentoring and inspiring them, organizing community activities, and pushing
	the limits of what people think is possible.

		{Engineering Manager}
		{Westwing}
		{I joined Westwing as a Software Developer for a brand new team working on re-platforming the frontend solution from PHP to serverside rendered react application. After a few months in the team, I've assumed the responsibilities of a people manager together with being responsible for the technical design of our application. My goal was to make our team performant and predictable, ensuring timely delivery of features necessary to conclude our re-platforming project.  I focused on enabling my team to constantly improve and hone their skills, providing guidance, and giving them enough freedom to share their ideas. All that allowed us to get back on track with the project and deliver a high-quality product. Apart from doing team-related activities I've also kickstarted company-wide knowledge sharing sessions in the form of lightning talks. As our re-platforming project has proven to be successful and in the light of a very successful 2020, the company decided to proceed with further expanding our new tech platform to other areas of the website. To speed up the process it was decided to start new teams responsible for other website domains, and a special growth team that would aim to improve business KPIs on existing pages.
		My top priority was keeping the engineering culture that we've managed to build during this considerable headcount growth phase as well as pushing the frontend system architecture in a direction that would allow multiple teams to work at their own pace without impacting each other deliverables.

		{Full stack developer}
		{Check24}
		{I was a part of a team building an Unfallversicherung part of Check24 web portal. It is a rich single page application built with knockout.js and a backend build by micro services architecture approach combining .net and node.js for tasks where they fit best. Another web application we develop is a customer area, where the client can access previously created contracts or offers. It is a single page application built with react and MobX. I contribute to our application on all levels from front-end part, down to back end and internal development and analytical tools. I introduced and set up elastic stack installation for monitoring and analysis of our microservices landscape. I also work with junior developers and working students providing guidance and making sure they learn our code-style, best practices and tools we use and helping them quickly get up to speed.

		{Senior Application Developer}
		{Deutsche Bank}
		{I worked on the User Interface for an order management system used by sales traders in the front office. This was a click-once distributed plug-in based WPF application. The codebase had a high level of unit test coverage, and used the inversion of control pattern extensively. I was responsible for implementing new business features from server interaction to controls and visualizations; designing new subsystems of our application and refactoring the existing ones. I initiated the transition process of the codebase from SVN to git repository using Atlassian Stash as a main repo. This helped to achieve 100% code review coverage for committed code. Coupled with the Teamcity build configurations I ensured no bad code could get into the main development branch undetected. I also introduced and supported the idea of coded feature tests that ensured our subsystems were tested against specific business requirements thus reducing the time of manual regression testing and improving the quality of the product.
